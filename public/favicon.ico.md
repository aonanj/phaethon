# Favicon placeholder

To add a proper favicon.ico file:

1. Create a 32x32 pixel PNG image of your logo
2. Convert it to ICO format using an online converter
3. Replace this file with the actual favicon.ico

For now, you can use the logo.svg as your favicon by referencing it in the metadata (which is already done in layout.tsx).
